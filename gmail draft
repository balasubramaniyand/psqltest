Hi Team,

I am working at SupportFirst Deployment Automation. I was able to intergate Jenkins with Pexgit using the provided credentials.
I faced the below issue when trying to integrate with APIs. Maybe the reason I am trying to store the Jenkins API credentials in Pexgit is that it is not allowing me to store the credentials, resulting in an error "Url is blocked: Requests to the local network are not allowed." This is for Pexgit server-side use.Â 

This API setup is done. First, support is automated. for the deployment
